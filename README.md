## Installation

To use this codebase, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sidharthsahoodev/CricketPlayOffs.git
   ```

2. Ensure that you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.

3. Open the project in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

4. Set up the required dependencies. The project uses Maven for dependency management. The `build.gradle` file contains the necessary dependencies:

    - JUnit Jupiter API for testing
    - JUnit Jupiter Engine for test execution
    - PostgreSQL JDBC driver for connecting to the database

   The dependencies will be automatically downloaded by Maven.

5. Set up the PostgreSQL database:
    - Create a database named `WinScenarioPredictorDB`.
    - Modify the connection URL in the codebase to match your PostgreSQL database configuration. Replace `localhost:5432` with the appropriate host and port, and update the username and password accordingly.

6. Run the `Main` class in your IDE or through the command line.
   The `Main` class serves as the entry point for the program. When executed, it performs the following steps:


## Usage

1. Retrieves team data from the PostgreSQL database.
2. Retrieves fixture data from the PostgreSQL database.
3. Generates all possible outcomes for the fixtures.
4. Generates all possible scenarios based on the outcomes.
5. Initializes the points table with team data.
6. Calculates points, wins, and losses for each scenario.
7. Calculates probabilities for each team's position.
8. Prints the probabilities for each team's position.

The program outputs the probabilities for each team's position in the playoffs.

## Prompt used for generating comprehensive comments (Any Language)

"
{Paste the code you want commented}

You have been provided with the {Coding Language Name} code that contains a complex implementation. Act as a seasoned software developer with expertise in {Coding Language Name}. The task is to carefully analyze the code and add comprehensive comments to enhance its readability, maintainability, and understandability. Follow these guidelines to achieve the best results:

1. Thoroughly understand the code: Take the time to read and comprehend the entire code file. Identify the main functionality, algorithms, and data structures used. Understand the purpose of each class, method, and variable.

2. Identify key sections: Break down the code into logical sections or modules. Look for major blocks of code, loops, conditional statements, or complex logic. These will be the areas where you'll want to add more detailed comments. Focus on areas that are critical for understanding the code's behavior and flow.

3. Document class-level comments: Begin by adding a comment block at the top of the class to describe its purpose, overall functionality, and any important details about the class. Include information such as the author, creation date, and modification history if applicable. Summarize the class's responsibilities and its relationship to other classes.

4. Document method-level comments: Go through each method and add comments to describe its purpose, input parameters, output values, and any specific behavior or algorithm used. Explain the intention behind the method and provide any necessary information for the reader to understand its functionality. Highlight any edge cases, assumptions, or constraints that should be considered when using the method.

5. Explain complex logic: Identify any sections of code that involve complex algorithms, intricate business logic, or non-obvious decision-making processes. Break down these sections into smaller steps and add comments to explain the thought process, assumptions, and key decision points. Use diagrams, pseudocode, or examples if needed to illustrate the logic clearly.

6. Document inputs and outputs: For methods with input parameters, comment on the expected data types, ranges, or any special conditions. Similarly, document the output values and their significance. Provide examples whenever possible to demonstrate the expected behavior. Clarify any side effects or dependencies associated with method invocations.

7. Comment non-obvious code: Add comments to clarify any code that may be difficult to understand at first glance. This could include complex expressions, optimizations, or any unconventional coding practices. Explain the rationale behind these choices and provide references to relevant resources or documentation.

8. Comment out unused code: If you come across code that is no longer in use, comment it out to indicate that it's not active code. This helps keep the codebase clean, reduces confusion, and improves the overall maintainability.

9. Regularly review and update: Code evolves over time, and so should its comments. As you make changes or improvements, remember to update the comments accordingly. Regularly reviewing and maintaining comments ensures their accuracy and relevance. Collaborate with other developers to gather feedback and iterate on the comments for continuous improvement.

Please thoroughly analyze the provided {Coding Language Name} code file and add comprehensive comments as per the guidelines mentioned above, generating comments until the end of the file. Focus on improving the code's readability, explaining complex logic, documenting inputs and outputs, providing relevant examples, and offering necessary context to understand the code's functionality. Your goal is to make the code easily understandable for yourself and other developers who may need to work with it in the future.
